qemu-img resize 2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch-lite.img +2G
kpartx -av 2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch-lite.img
mount /dev/mapper/loop0p2 /mnt/
comment all in /mnt/etc/fstab, just leave uncomentent line that starts with proc
comment all in /mnt/etc/ld.so.preload
unmount /mnt
kpartx -d 2016-11-29-raspbian-stretch-lite.img

so now we add more space to the image but here comes the parted
no one knows how to do:

"resize the filesystem ext4 to the added 2 GB"
------IMPORTANT, HOW TO EXPAND THE FILESYSTEM ----------
NOTE:***GPARTED IS NEEDED***
this is the faster method I found by myself getting mad xD

first you need to mount in a loop the image, this is because
you want to map the whole image and not only each partition as
the kpartx method did.

as root mount into a loop10:
#losetup /dev/loop10 2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch-lite.img

#gparted /dev/loop10

once we are into gparted, next step is to move the second partition
(ext4) to the end of the free space, after that, you apply changes,
then you expand it backwards to the freespace and appy changes again.
NOTE:there where some errors if i expandit normally but this way worked,
    if someone know a better solution and why this happends please update.

umount the loop10

losetup /dev/loop10 2017-11-29-raspbian-stretch-lite.img

DONE ;)

now run the runQemuPI2.sh
./runQemuPI2.sh
and have fun :D
